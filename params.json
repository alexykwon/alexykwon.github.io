I have extensive experience with working with cross functional technical and business teams and the Agile software development lifecycle. My focus has been on creating web products that deliver value from the first iteration using JavaScript frameworks, Swift, and Java along with Google APIs. Below are some of the websites and applications I have completed this past year.\r\n\r\n### Kent Station Mobile \r\n![Kent Station](http://i.imgur.com/AGU39y6.png)\r\nCynthia, the Marketing Manager at Kent Station, approached us about creating an app called [Kent Station Mobile](https://c9.io/alexykwon/kent-station/files) to increase user engagement while on the premises and provide a great multi-platform experience for both Android and iOS phones. Because of the short development period, we went with PhoneGap to utilize it's hybrid-web application features. Currently the site runs on a combination of Bootstrap and jQuery Mobile for its ability to gracefully adapt to all screen sizes. The next iteration of the site implements Angular for its smooth UI and better data display and handling. \r\n\r\n### Jameson Home Inspections  \r\n![Jameson](http://i.imgur.com/bR5DsvN.png)\r\n[Jameson Home Inspections](https://c9.io/matthewgibson/jameson-home-inspection/files) runs on the LAMP stack and features a jQuery price quote tool and a PHP form to contact the site owner through email. James' original site was made with a templating tool that for desktop browsers. The redesign conformed to mobile web standards and provided a fresh, modern feel for the home inspection experience. A custom price generator for potential clients was created in order to provide value and motivate them to contact James immediately. An email capture form/mailing list helps James notify clients on any updates and marketing promotions.\r\n\r\n### Brow Towel \r\n![Brow Towel](http://i.imgur.com/nq9Zo9K.png)\r\n[Brow Towel](http://browtowel.greenrivertech.net) represents one of our most successful projects in terms of revenue generated. In the first week of the site going live, we sold 70 units of product! TJ, a student with great contacts in the local King County restaurant industry, was the brains behind the product and came to us for assistance on with developing a web presence and mobile shop. We put together everything he needed from start to finish, from the server install to the shopping cart. \r\n\r\n### Gatormapp \r\n![Gatormapp](http://i.imgur.com/bR5DsvN.png)\r\nThe first mobile application to be published on the Google Play store, [Gatormapp](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.directions.gatormapp) provides new (and old!) students help find their way on campus. Developed in Java with Android Studio and Gradle, the application fetched map data and walking directions from the Google Maps/Places API in JSON format and used their location to guide students to their destination. I learned a lot about using web services and how to parse data in XML and JSON formats. UI development was another focus of the app in the form of weekly usability testing and redesigns. The project is now under the Technology Club's umbrella and an iOS version is on its way.
